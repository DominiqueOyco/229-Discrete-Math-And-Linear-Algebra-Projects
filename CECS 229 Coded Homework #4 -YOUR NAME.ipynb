    "Yours truly likes to listen to a band called \"Alt-J\".  Take a look at the music video for their song, \"Matilda\" at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q06wFUi5OM8.  The faces you see morphing into one another are the faces of the four members who were in the band at the time.  In this exercise you will explore how a simplified version of this \"morphing effect\" can be achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Background:***\n",
    "\n",
    "First, keep in mind that a video is just a collection of several still images displayed with a speed fast enough to make the change from one image to another imperceptible to the human eye.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To make the discussion simpler, suppose the images are grayscale pictures.  We can represent a grayscale picture with $m \\times n$ pixels as a matrix $M \\in \\mathbb{R}_{m\\times n}$.  Each entry $m_{ij}$ of the matrix $M$ is the intensity value of the pixel at location $(i, j)$, [* Recall these values range from 0 (black) to 255 (white) *].  In the written homework problem set for vectors and vector spaces, you proved that $\\mathbb{R}_{m \\times n}$ is a vector space, hence given a set  $\\mathbb{I} \\subset \\mathbb{R}_{m \\times n}$ of two \"image-matrices\", we can form convex combinations of these two elements with the confidence that the resulting matrices will be in $\\mathbb{R}_{m \\times n}$. Let's express this a little more formally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $\\mathbb{I} = \\{I_i\\in \\mathbb{R}_{m\\times n} \\; | i = 1, 2\\}$ is a set of 2 matrices and $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 = 1$.  Then, \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hspace{10cm} I = \\alpha_1 \\; I_1 + \\alpha_2 \\; I_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}_{m \\times n}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Think: what would the image corresponding to matrix $I$ look like if $I = 0.5 I_1 + 0.5 I_2$?  Since the images $I_1$ and $I_2$ make an equal contribution to the intensity of each pixel in $I$, we can expect the image to look like an equal mix of the two images. e.g. if the two images contain faces in more-or-less the same position, the resulting image should display a face that more-or-less looks like both faces.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What if $I = 0.85 I_1 + 0.15 I_2$?  Then, since most of the intensity in each pixel of $I$ is being contributed by $I_1$, we can expect the resulting image $I$ to display something that looks more like the first image, $I_1$, vs the second image, $I_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Your tasks***\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create the functions:\n",
    " * `png2graymatrix(filename)` - creates and returns a `Matrix` object with the image data returned by `file2image()` from the module `image` that you downloaded to complete Coded HW #3; `filename` is a string data type specifying the location of the image you wish to use.  If the image is not grayscale, you must convert it to grayscale prior to creating the `Matrix` object.  You can do so using the functions `isgray()` and `color2gray()`, also found in the `image` module.\n",
    " * `graymatrix2png(image_matrix, path)` - creates a png file out of a `Matrix` object.  You may want to use the function `image2file()` from the `image` module.\n",
    "2. Download and extract the zip folder `faces.zip`.  In it, you will find the images of 15 male faces and 5 female faces.  Use the functions from part 1. to create a program that generates a set of 100 images.  These images must be the result of taking convex combinations of the two faces you chose, so that one face appears to morph into the other. i.e. create 100 different convex combinations of the two images so that the 1st/100 picture looks completely like one face, the 50th/100 picture looks like both faces equally mixed together, and the 100th/100 picture looks like the second face only.  \n",
    "3. **EXTRA CREDIT** Pick 4 images, and modify your program from part 2. so that it generates a set of 400 pictures, where the first 100 pictures show the first face morphing into the second face, the second-hundred pictures show the second face morphing into the third face, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **EXTRA-EXTRA CREDIT** Create a video using the images you generated in part 4. (you can generate and use more images to make the morphing-effect look nicer if you want).  I have attached the function `make_video()` (taken from http://www.xavierdupre.fr/blog/2016-03-30_nojs.html) for you to use, or you can come up with your own solution.  NOTE: if you intend to use the attached function, you will need to download and install OpenCV and Numpy, if you do not already have it installed.\n",
